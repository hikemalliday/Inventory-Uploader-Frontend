# Inventory-Uploader

##### A website that allows the user to create an account, and upload character inventory files to a backend server (For Everquest, an MMORPG). 

### Local Installation:
I have added a 'docker-compose' folder, which contains a docker-compose.yaml. Run this YAML to pull both the backend and frontend images from Docker Hub and launch the website locally.

###### Docker Hub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/hikemalliday/inventory-uploader-frontend

This is my first project created with ReactJS. It is also my first project to use the web browser built in file submission functionality.
The table is created with a library called React Table.
